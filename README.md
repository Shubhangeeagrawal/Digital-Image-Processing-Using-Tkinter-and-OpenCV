# Digital-Image-Processing-Using-Tkinter-and-OpenCV
Developed a software for digital image processing using Python and OpenCV to enhance images with features like image smoothing,  edge detection, and noise reduction. 
# Overview
This project is a digital image processing application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to upload and manipulate images using various image processing techniques. The application is built using Python and leverages libraries like OpenCV, PIL (Pillow), and Tkinter for image processing and GUI functionalities.

# Features
Upload Images: Users can upload .jpg or .png files.
Grayscale Conversion: Convert the uploaded image to grayscale.
Negative Transformation: Apply a negative filter to the image.
Image Filtering: Apply various filters to enhance or detect features in the image.
# Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for developing the application.
Tkinter: Used for building the graphical user interface.
OpenCV: Employed for advanced image processing functions.
PIL (Pillow): Utilized for image manipulation.
Matplotlib: Used for plotting and visualizing data (potentially within the GUI).
